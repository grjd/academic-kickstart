## Description

Resiliency in Biological and Natural Systems

Extreme Value Theory
Contagion/Epidemics
Risk


In this project we explored the shape of the most enduring AfD conversations.
We looked at two types of conversations: those in which the final consensus was
to delete (above), and those in which it was to keep. 

The project was released in celebration of the tenth anniversary from
Wikipedia's creation. In 2012 it received the _Kantar Information is
Beautiful Awards_  for [best interactive
visualization](//www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/443-notabilia).
The awarding jury included -- among others -- MoMA curator Paola
Antonelli and Brian Eno.

## Collaborators
