## A different perspective on the brain
A mechanistic characterization of human brain aging in the human population may seem out of reach. Brain Big Data analytics open unpaved  avenues for new insights of the inner workings of the brain. The integration of all available evidence into a theoretical corpus with both explanatory and predictive power is a promising strategy. 
Understanding the human brain as a complex organ that allows adaptive behavioral strategies to cope with an uncertain world, can help get us getting closer to P4 medicine: Predictive, Preventive, Personalized and Participatory.

## Mission
The Madrid Brain Longevity initiative seeks to deepen our understanding of how the human mind works, combining different imaging technologies (MRI, MEG, EEG) with microbiomics and to build explanatory models to improve how we treat and prevent disorders of the brain. We aim at uncovering how exercise and life style decisions influence the microbiome-gut-brain axis.

## About Us

Madrid Brain Longevity is part of a pioneering collaborative effort aimed at developing new tools, models and theories that will foster our understanding of the aging human brain. We are a team of scientists, engineers and technologists working at Universities and Research Institutes located in Madrid area and working in close collaboration with world leaders in Neuroscience research.

## Funding
The Madrid Brain Longevity is an initiative created around the project RTI2018-098762-B-C31 funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovaci√≥n y Universidades. "Study of the anatomo-functional connectome of AD-relatives: an early intervention on cognitive al lifestyles (CONNECT-AD)"
