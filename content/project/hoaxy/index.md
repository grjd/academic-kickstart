## Description

Epistemology from the Greek episteme” and “logos” or _What it was to know_, and _How knowledge is good for the knower_. The porject addresses these topics trying to bring new insights into appartently distant topics. We expect that Epistemolgy as a discipline, in tandem with algorithms and the exponentiation of data and computer power will help us to vertebrate a new way of understanding the workd and to build explanatory and predictive models.
