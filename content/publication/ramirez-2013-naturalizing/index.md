abstract: "This paper explores issues concerning naturalized epistemology and the use of isomorphism criteria in the analysis and construction of autonomous systems. A naturalized epistemic account is proposed following the constructivist paradigm. We begin by defining the basis level, where irreducible extralogical-phenomenic primitives are set out. Upon the simple primitives of basis level, further and more complex levels are defined, through a subsumption process, permitting to correlate different conceptual levels in terms of their respective primitives. Following this constructivist practice, we expect to obtain a shaped set of isomorphisms between the system form, that is, the epistemic part of the system, and a range of perceived objects and events of the environment where the system is placed."
