Jaime Gomez-Ramirez is a Scientific Project Officer at the <strong>European Commission</strong>'s Joint Research Center, [Centre for Advanced Studies](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research/centre-advanced-studies). He is professor at Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Visiting Professor at the University of Turin, Italy. 
He completed his postdoctoral training in <strong>Japan</strong> at the Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, [Okayama University](http://www.biolab.mech.okayama-u.ac.jp/startE.html/), the <strong>USA</strong> at the Centre for Sleep and Consciousness, [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://centerforsleepandconsciousness.med.wisc.edu/) and <strong>Canada</strong> at The Sickkids Hospital, Department of Neuroscience & Mental Health, [University of Toronto](http://www.sickkids.ca/Research/Neurosciences-and-mental-health/index.html/).

<!-- GOES IN VITA: He was visiting Researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, University of Palermo and the Humboldt University, Berlin.He worked for several years in the private sector as a consultant and as team leader in France and Spain for IT and consulting firms. Since 2004, he has returned to Academia, where he currently continues his role as a Research Scholar and Professor.-->

Jaime Gomez-Ramirez is a scientist with experience in the Private Sector IT and in allocation of R&D funding and advising governamental and private bodies in funding innovative science.

Professor Gomez-Ramirez research is focused on multi-scale mathematical modelling of <strong>complex systems</strong>, specifically <strong>brain networks</strong>. An original aspect of his work is the use of [Category Theory](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789400777378) in brain connectivity. Working as a computational neuroscientist, he is interested in foster our understanding of brain networks <strong>dynamics</strong> that what they tell us about <strong>brain healthy aging</strong>. He has a broad training as a experimental and clinical neuroscientist in neuroimaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (iEEG).

Gomez-Ram√≠rez is also interested in the Social Sciences, in particular Economics. Complexity science is likely to transform our understanding of Economics and the markets viewed and modeled as Complex Adaptive Systems. 
Both Science and Art are human attempts to understand the world around us. Although the traditions, "languages" and methods differ,   the motivations and goals are fundamentally the same. We may be closer than ever to bringing together the interdisciplinary gap between art and science, also known as the two cultures.
