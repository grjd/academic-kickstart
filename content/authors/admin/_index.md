Jaime Gomez-Ramirez is a Research Scientist at The Alzheimer Centre at Fundación Reina Sofía. He is professor at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Universidad Pontificia de Comillas and Visiting Professor at the University of Turin. 
He completed his postdoctoral training in <strong>Japan</strong> at the Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, [Okayama University](http://www.biolab.mech.okayama-u.ac.jp/startE.html/), the <strong>USA</strong> at the Centre for Sleep and Consciousness, [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://centerforsleepandconsciousness.med.wisc.edu/) and <strong>Canada</strong> at The Sickkids Hospital, Department of Neuroscience & Mental Health, [University of Toronto](http://www.sickkids.ca/Research/Neurosciences-and-mental-health/index.html/).

<!-- GOES IN VITA: He was visiting Researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, University of Palermo and the Humboldt University, Berlin.He worked for several years in the private sector as a consultant and as team leader in France and Spain for IT and consulting firms. Since 2004, he has returned to Academia, where he currently continues his role as a Research Scholar and Professor.-->

Professor Gomez-Ramirez <strong>research</strong> is focused on multi-scale mathematical modelling of <strong>complex systems</strong>, specifically <strong>brain networks</strong>. An original aspect of his work is the use of [Category Theory](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789400777378) in brain connectivity. Working as a computational neuroscientist, he is interested in foster our understanding of brain networks <strong>dynamics</strong> that what they tell us about <strong>brain healthy aging</strong>. He has a broad training as a experimental and clinical neuroscientist in neuroimaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (iEEG).

Gomez-Ramírez is also interested in Neuroaesthetics and the Arts. Neuroaesthetics can be seen as a way of bridging the interdisciplinary gap between art and science; a recent scientific discipline that can help to finally dissolve the 
["two cultures"](http://www.aslab.org/~sanz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=54&Itemid=29).
