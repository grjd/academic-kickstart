abstract = "The physicist Eugene Wigner in ”The unreasonable effectiveness of
mathematics in natural science” [4] observed that the appropriateness
of mathematics for describing natural phenomena is ”a wonderful gift
which we neither understand nor deserve”. While some have argued
this ”gift” is in reality a necessary consequence of the physical world
being mathematical, more precisely, the physical world is isomorphic
to a mathematical structure that we are in the process of discovering
[3], [2], [1], it is undeniable that the success of mathematics approxi-
mating physics contrast strongly with the moderate and slow pace of
mathematical modeling in biology and social science. In the last years,
the emergence of large datasets coupled with the drastic reduction of
computational cost and the ubiquity of distributed sensing objects
have initiated a new era where the emphasis is not anymore in the
correctness, simplicity or elegance of theories, it rather relies on find-
ing conclusions from data (as opposed to theories). Neuroscience has
not been any exception to this paradigm shift. In this talk will discuss
recent progress being made in modeling brain function using machine
learning methods, notably deep networks and manifold learning. We
will point out the limitations and problems waiting ahead in computa-
tional neuroscience. A satisfactory phenomenological theory of brain
function written in mathematical formulae and computationally im-
plemented will still need to help us understand aesthetics, creativity
and value. New models and computational architectures that deal
with these issues will also be described."
